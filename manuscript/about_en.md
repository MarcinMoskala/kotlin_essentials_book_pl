# Kotlin for developers: Essentials

Kotlin is a powerful language, largely thanks to its expressive syntax, intuitive and null-safe type system, and great tooling support. Itâ€™s no wonder that Kotlin is the most popular language for Android development and is a popular replacement for Java on backend applications. It is also used for data science and for multiplatform, iOS, desktop, and web application development.
